<h4>Khalifa Fund Entrepreneur Development â€“ UAE where we have studied the organization requirements and fine-tuned areas of:</h4>

<h6>1. Network (WAN/LAN) Architecture  </h6>
<h6>2. Cloud adoption in a hybrid setup  </h6>
<h6>3. Endpoint Management (Updates, Patching, Asset Management) implemented completely  </h6>
<h6>4. Cyber Security Posture and Controls implementation.  </h6>
   a. Threat hunting using CoPilot  
   b. Sentinel SEIM Solution  
<h6>5. Business Continuity  </h6>
<h6>6. Compliance to ISO 27001: 2022 and GRC  </h6>

- Redesigned the Network Architecture to complement the Cyber Security controls, such as private peering, enabling firewalls, VPN, and processes where needed, thus overall optimizing ROI.  
- Migrated all critical servers to Azure Cloud and replicated the data to on-prem server storages as per availability and BCM requirements.  
- Enabled myapps with CASB for employees to enable VPN-free remote working.  
- Copilot: Deployment of Copilot on Azure with user behaviour analysis provides real-time threat analysis, triage, and root cause of the incident, further drilling down.  
- Intune: Migrated all endpoint devices, including servers, into groups and managed using MDM, which gives us greater flexibility with the applications running on the assets and their associated security vulnerabilities.  

Conducted training and awareness campaigns across the organization to ensure the cybersecurity maturity of the organization is optimal.  
Conducted an external and internal ASR (attack surface reduction) by using tools and working with domain admins to secure the external and internal architecture and brand monitoring from social media, employees, the dark web, and inactive residual information left on the Internet that could pose a threat.
