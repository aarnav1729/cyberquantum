<h2>Quantum-safe cryptography refers to efforts to identify algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, to keep information assets secure even after a large-scale quantum computer has been built.</h2>

<p>Quantum computing holds immense potential to transform cyber security by enhancing threat prevention, accelerating threat recovery, and bolstering cyber resiliency. By leveraging quantum principles, organisations can develop more secure encryption methods, rapidly detect and respond to threats, and maintain business continuity in the face of cyber attacks. As quantum technology continues to evolve, its integration with AI and cyber security will be crucial in creating robust, adaptive, and future-proof security systems.</p>

<p>In cybersecurity, “quantum security” is pivotal due to quantum computing’s potential to undermine encryption. This emerging field aims to develop quantum-resistant algorithms to protect digital communications against quantum threats. With quantum computers poised to break traditional cryptography, the urgency for quantum security innovations is paramount. This proactive approach, advocated by institutions like NIST, seeks to ensure a resilient cybersecurity infrastructure capable of withstanding the advanced computational power of quantum technology, thus safeguarding our digital future against potential breaches.</p>
